# Blockchain-Demand-Side-Management
Blockchain and machine learning-based system for dynamic demand-side management in smart grids, enabling transparent P2P energy trading and optimized energy distribution.
# Blockchain-Enabled Dynamic Demand-Side Management for Smart Grids

This project explores the integration of **Blockchain** and **Machine Learning** to optimize 
energy consumption and distribution within smart grids. The goal is to enable transparent, 
secure, and decentralized energy management through peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading.

## üîç Overview
Traditional energy grids face challenges in balancing supply and demand, leading to inefficiencies 
and high operational costs. By using blockchain technology, this system introduces transparency 
and automation in energy transactions, while machine learning helps forecast energy demand 
for dynamic demand-side management.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features
- **Energy Demand Forecasting** using Python-based ML algorithms  
- **Blockchain Integration** via private network and smart contracts  
- **Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading** between prosumers and consumers  
- **Dynamic Pricing Optimization** to balance grid load  
- **Revenue Analysis and Visualization** for energy transactions  

## üß† Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Web3.py**
- **Smart Contracts (Solidity / Ethereum Testnet)**
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib**
- **Blockchain Simulation for P2P Trading**

## üìä Results
- Improved transparency and traceability in energy transactions  
- Increased revenue for prosumers through direct sales  
- Reduced consumer energy costs via optimized distribution  
- Scalable architecture for integration with real smart grids
